# power-grid-anomaly-detection
This project is the result of my Master’s thesis focused on detecting anomalies in power grid infrastructures using machine learning techniques. It introduces a comprehensive methodology for identifying abnormal patterns in power consumption data — essential for early detection of faults, cyber-attacks, or equipment failures in modern smart grids.
